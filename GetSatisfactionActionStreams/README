To install, just copy the contents of mt-static into your mt-static directory,
and the contents of plugins into your plugins directory.

Changes in Version 1.1

Fixed the YAML for topics started to make it work properly

Note that at this time, replies do not work properly, but I've left them in
place should the API change to support them.
