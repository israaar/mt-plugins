In order for this plugin to function effectively, you must also add the
YourData application to Facebook, and follow its instructions. That application
is available at http://apps.facebook.com/yourdata , and a page dedicated to
how it works is at http://ussjoin.com/yourdata.html .

Once you've done that, just edit your Facebook Action Streams configuration (if
you have previously added your Facebook profile to Action Streams) and grant it
permission to update with your feeds.

To install, just copy the contents of mt-static into your mt-static directory,
and the contents of plugins into your plugins directory.
